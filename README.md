## Developer Quickstart Repo

This repo is intended to have scripts and tests available to allow for testing UMA contracts. The repo uses the `OptimisticDepositBox` and `EventBasedPredictionMarket` contracts as examples.

## Install dependencies

You will need to install the long-term support version of nodejs, currently nodejs v16. You will also need to install yarn.

## Build

```shell
yarn
yarn hardhat compile
```

## Test

```shell
yarn test # Run unit tests
```

## Lint

```shell
yarn lint
yarn lint-fix
```

## Deploying your contracts

Use the command below to deploy a particular contract (along with any dependencies that haven't been deployed on this network). In the deploy script, the `func.tags` determines the contracts to deploy which is specified using the `--tags` arg in the command:

```sh
export MNEMONIC="Your 12-word phrase here"
export CUSTOM_NODE_URL="Your node url here"
yarn hardhat deploy --network goerli --tags OptimisticDepositBox,EventBasedPredictionMarket
```

## Contract verification

To perform an etherscan verification on a particular contract address that you have deployed on a public network:

```sh
export ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="Your etherscan api key here"
export CUSTOM_NODE_URL="Your node url here"
yarn hardhat verify "Your contract address here" --network goerli
```

To perform a verification on all the contracts you have deployed on a particular network:

```sh
export CUSTOM_NODE_URL="Your node url here"
export ETHERSCAN_API_KEY="Your etherscan api key here"
yarn hardhat etherscan-verify --network goerli --license AGPL-3.0 --force-license
```


## Additional Notes

The DepositBox is a good example of a way  to integrate the optimistic oracle into a lending protocol

What this means is the OO can be used to request the price of assets @ withdrawl from the protocol, to ensure accurate prices for assets.

This is extremely important:  See this Article highlighting how Mango Markets was hacked due to an oracle manipulation attack on the protocol [Mago Markets Hack](https://compoziteresearch.medium.com/oracle-manipulation-risks-in-lending-pools-0458c362d294)
